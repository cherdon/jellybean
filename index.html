				<p>Long before the year 2019, humans have been warned of the impending danger of climate change. Governments have tried their best to minimize global warming and its effects, but it seems like we have acted too late, and too little. </p>
				<p>Commercial companies exploited earth of almost all its resources. Putting profits first, they continued the practice of burning fossil fuels and polluting our air with greenhouse gases. </p>
				<p>Melting glaciers and rising sea levels - What was once only seen as a problem of the future, has now become a reality. </p>
				<p>Earth is no longer our place to live. Temperatures have become so high that most livestock have died, and humans could be next. Cities and forests were all flooded, even using kayaks as our mode of transport was not feasible anymore. </p>
