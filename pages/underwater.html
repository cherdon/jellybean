				<p>In order to adapt, humans had no choice but to find somewhere else to live. We turned to the underwaters â€“ there were not many options, since most of our planet was underwater anyway.</p>
				<p>Life underwater was a far cry from what everyone was used to. We could only try our best to replicate portions of life above the ground. Without sunlight, many flora and fauna we had could no longer survive. In place of the beautiful forests we once had, stands a piece of land filled with artificial trees and flowers. This was all we could do for those who still wanted to appreciate the beauty of nature. As for the animals, only a few of each species were brought underwater. They were kept in special conditions with temperatures suited for their survival, and only a limited number of people could visit them each day.</p>
