				<p>We could no longer rear cattle like we used to, nor could we grow crops that thrive under sunlight. We had to make do with what was left for us. Diets consisted mainly of crops we grew indoors with artificial light, and occasionally fishes and other animals that roam the sea.</p>
				<p>When we first migrated underwater, each household was rationed some vegetables and fruits that could grow indoors, such as carrots or gingers. They were then responsible for growing and reproducing these vegetables for their own consumption, and new ones would only be given to them at the start of each year. For those who could afford high end technology, this was not a problem as they could rely on machinery to ensure that they always have a supply of top-quality food.</p>
				<p>When it came to animal meat, people had to bid for meat, and it definitely was not cheap. Afterall, there was a very limited supply.</p>
