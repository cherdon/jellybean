				<p>When humans moved underwater to the home of many marine life, we became the minority. We barely had enough to survive. Majority of the population underwater were made up of jellyfish, and humans started to see this as a threat.</p>
				<p>Conditions for jellyfish to grow and thrive were all present. Warmer oceans and lower oxygen levels caused other animals to suffer, but not jellyfish. Due to fishing many years back, the population jellyfishâ€™s natural predators such as tuna and swordfish, and those they compete with for food, such as anchovies, have depleted. With optimal living conditions and less competitors and predators, jellyfish populations grew unchecked.</p>
				<p>Even when we still lived on land, the overpopulation of jellyfish has done harm to us. Power plants supporting large operations have been forced to shut down when an invasion of jellyfish started blocking their cooling filters.</p>
