				<p>Feeling threatened by the overpopulation of jellyfish, humans started to hunt for jellyfish as their source of food.</p>
				<p>Supply of jellyfish never seemed to run out, and that made business owners snatch the opportunity to make money from the jellyfish hunting business. They used the advanced technology to bring hunting for jellyfish to a new level. Artificial intelligence machines would track the movement of jellyfish and observe where in the ocean the jellyfish would appear most frequently. Autonomous machines would hunt the jellyfish, at a rate that was far more efficient than humans could ever manage.</p>
				<p>As jellyfish became more and more incorporated into our diets, they started to become a type of graded food. Rare jellyfish such as the drymonema dalmatinum were sold at a more expensive price as compared to common jellyfish species such as the moon jellyfish. Food companies then competed to hunt for the top-grade jellyfish, and more specialized machinery were invented.</p>
